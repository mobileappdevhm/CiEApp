Requirements Overview {#_requirements_overview}
---------------------

**Contents.**

Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces,
extract (or abstract) of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing)
requirements documents (with version number and information where to
find it).

**Motivation.**

From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified
to improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

**Form.**

Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format. If
requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these
documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this
document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.
