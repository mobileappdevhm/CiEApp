Cross-cutting Concepts {#section-concepts}
======================

**Content.**

This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas
that are relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks. They can
include many different topics, such as

-   domain models

-   architecture patterns or design patterns

-   rules for using specific technology

-   principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions

-   implementation rules

**Motivation.**

Concepts form the basis for *conceptual integrity* (consistency,
homogeneity) of the architecture. Thus, they are an important
contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we
provided for a cohesive specification of such concepts.

**Form.**

The form can be varied:

-   concept papers with any kind of structure

-   cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the
    architecture views

-   sample implementations, especially for technical concepts

-   reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using
    Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

**Structure.**

A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

-   Domain concepts

-   User Experience concepts (UX)

-   Safety and security concepts

-   Architecture and design patterns

-   "Under-the-hood"

-   development concepts

-   operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one
specific topic on this list.

Design Decisions {#section-design-decisions}
================

**Contents.**

Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions
including rationals. With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative
based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision
should be documented here in this central section or whether you better
document it locally (e.g. within the white box template of one building
block).

Avoid redundancy. Refer to section 4, where you already captured the
most important decisions of your architecture.

**Motivation.**

Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace
your decisions.

**Form.**

Various options:

-   List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:

-   more detailed in form of separate sections per decision

-   ADR (architecture decision record) for every important decision

Quality Requirements {#section-quality-scenarios}
====================

**Content.**

This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with
scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in
section 1.2. (quality goals)

Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority,
which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.

**Motivation.**

Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural
decisions you should know for every stakeholder what is really important
to them, concrete and measurable.

Quality Tree {#_quality_tree}
------------

**Content.**

The quality tree (as defined in ATAM – Architecture Tradeoff Analysis
Method) with quality/evaluation scenarios as leafs.

**Motivation.**

The tree structure with priorities provides an overview for a sometimes
large number of quality requirements.

**Form.**

The quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and
requirements:

-   tree-like refinement of the term "quality". Use "quality" or
    "usefulness" as a root

-   a mind map with quality categories as main branches

In any case the tree should include links to the scenarios of the
following section.

Quality Scenarios {#_quality_scenarios}
-----------------

**Contents.**

Concretization of (sometimes vague or implicit) quality requirements
using (quality) scenarios.

These scenarios describe what should happen when a stimulus arrives at
the system.

For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:

-   Usage scenarios (also called application scenarios or use case
    scenarios) describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain
    stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s
    efficiency or performance. Example: The system reacts to a user’s
    request within one second.

-   Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its
    immediate environment. Example: Additional functionality is
    implemented or requirements for a quality attribute change.

**Motivation.**

Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to more easily
measure or decide whether they are fulfilled.

Especially when you want to assess your architecture using methods like
ATAM you need to describe your quality goals (from section 1.2) more
precisely down to a level of scenarios that can be discussed and
evaluated.

**Form.**

Tabular or free form text.

Risks and Technical Debts {#section-technical-risks}
=========================

**Contents.**

A list of identified technical risks or technical debts, ordered by
priority

**Motivation.**

“Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister,
Atlantic Systems Guild.)

This should be your motto for systematic detection and evaluation of
risks and technical debts in the architecture, which will be needed by
management stakeholders (e.g. project managers, product owners) as part
of the overall risk analysis and measurement planning.

**Form.**

List of risks and/or technical debts, probably including suggested
measures to minimize, mitigate or avoid risks or reduce technical debts.

Glossary {#section-glossary}
========

**Contents.**

The most important domain and technical terms that your stakeholders use
when discussing the system.

You can also see the glossary as source for translations if you work in
multi-language teams.

**Motivation.**

You should clearly define your terms, so that all stakeholders

-   have an identical understanding of these terms

-   do not use synonyms and homonyms

**Form.**

A table with columns &lt;Term&gt; and &lt;Definition&gt;.

Potentially more columns in case you need translations.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Term                              | Definition                        |
+===================================+===================================+
| &lt;Term-1&gt;                    | &lt;definition-1&gt;              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| &lt;Term-2&gt;                    | &lt;definition-2&gt;              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
