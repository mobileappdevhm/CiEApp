Deployment View
===============

![Deployment Diagram](https://github.com/mobileappdevhm/CiEApp/blob/master/docs/architecture/images/deployment_w_nine.png)

There are several arguments for using *nine* for backend instead of creating yet another platform beside Primuss and every department's seperate service like the ZPA system of Department 07. 
- *nine* is already being used by five departments: 09, 10, 11, 12 and 13
- we don't need to create and maintain our own infrastructure (webserver, database etc.) as we can use the existing one of *nine*
- *nine* provides tracking of courses taken in previous semesters

If we are not able to use *nine* for our Courses in English App we would create a service as described in an [earlier proposal](https://github.com/mobileappdevhm/concept-team-2-fml-ben/wiki/Solution-Proposal-(Ben))
