Introduction and Goals {#section-introduction-and-goals}
======================

Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software
architects and development team must consider. These include

-   underlying business goals, essential features and functional
    requirements for the system

-   quality goals for the architecture

-   relevant stakeholders and their expectations

Requirements Overview {#_requirements_overview}
---------------------

**Contents.**

Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces,
extract (or abstract) of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing)
requirements documents (with version number and information where to
find it).

**Motivation.**

From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified
to improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

**Form.**

Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format. If
requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these
documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this
document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.

Quality Goals {#_quality_goals}
-------------

**Contents.**

The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose
fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. We
really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don’t confuse them with
project goals. They are not necessarily identical.

**Motivation.**

You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders,
since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. Make sure
to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords. If you as an
architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged …

**Form.**

A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities
